# Overview:
Chess is a game of strategy and decision-making, making it a perfect challenge for artificial intelligence. This project aims to develop a chess AI that can beat human players. The use of machine learning in this project will enable the AI to learn from human moves and strategies, becoming more proficient over time.

# Experience Gained:
```
Python
PyTorch
numpy
As well as the logistics of Chess
```

# Prerequisites:
```
Python 3
Pygame
numpy
PyTorch
python-chess
```

# How to use AlphaCheck:
This machine is currently capable of having the player (white pieces) play against the AI (black pieces). By using the Python-Chess and Pygame libraries we are able to construct the interface as well as the logic of a basic chess game. There is a text box at the bottom of the game window that will display information about the current game such as: (Black's turn, White's turn, Check, Checkmate, and Pawn Promotion instructions). There are two version of the AI, there is AlphaEngine.py which utilizes hard coded logic provided by myself for a computer openent. AlphaEngine_NN.py provides a computer openent that has been trained off of Grandmaster Level chess games. This model while more calculating than the basic implementation of AI does require more CPU power to perform its analysis and therefore takes a longer time to come to a decisive conclusion for what the most effective move should be. This project is still in development and is more than free to be downloaded and used at any individual's will. Thank you for looking at my project!
